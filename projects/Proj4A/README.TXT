Project 4A

This project was designed to get familiar with debuggers and memory checks.
We were given 3 programs with multiple errors. Detailed answers to errors are contained in errorslist.txt. 
GDB and Valgrind were used in this project. 
Programs labeled p#fixed.c are one way to fix the program to run correctly.
