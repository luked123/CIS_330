This project was designed to get familiar with file streams, and reading and writing to files. 
Program reads a Binary file that contains a two dimensional arrary of integers that is 10x10. 
The program then reads in only left corner of the 5x5 array and then writes these values to another outputfile.  
This is supposed to emulate reading pixels in an image.
