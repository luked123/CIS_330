Project 2D

This project adapts the structures created in project 2C. It creates a
supertype called Shape which hides the details of the smaller subtypes
Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. This demonstrates polymorphism, as well 
as function pointers allowing are code to be more managable. Say if another
Subtype "Square" was added. The code in driver2D.c would not have to be
changed. Enums and unions are also demonstrated in Project 2D. Enumeration
allows programs to define keywords that can make for better readability. 
They act exactly as integers. Unions allow a way to define multiple data types
for one object, and can act as a different one depending on the context.
